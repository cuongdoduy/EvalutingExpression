# EVALUATING EXPRESSIONS



## Introduction
* People usually evaluate an (arithmetic) expression by using its infix notation, where every operator lies in between two operands in the expression. However, itâ€™s not an effective way for a computer to evaluate such an expression. The computers use the prefix or postfix notations instead.

## Require Enviroment
* Install compiler g++ 

## Run Program
* Define testcase in file tc1_input.txt
* Run this command in terminal "g++ -o main main.cpp EvalutingExpression.cpp -I . -std=c++11 ; .\main tc1_input.txt"
